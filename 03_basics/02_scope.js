//---------- Interesting------------

//this is the basic function 
addOne(5)    //we can declare this before function declaration
function addOne(num){
    return num+1;
}
// addOne(5)

//this is also function but we can called it expression also
// this addTwo treat like variable that can hold functions, json etc.

//addTwo(5)   //{ we can't call expression before function declaration, It will trough the error}
const addTwo = function(num){
    return num+2;

addTwo(5)
